The Dom / Adventure Game
========================

One of the early stage assignments at We Got Coders Full-Stack Ruby Web Development course. (wegotcoders.com)  
Basic exercise that helped us understand how webpages work and learn about the DOM.
After the exercise we've created a small adventure game which is a few HTML pages linked together
with some added CSS styles.
