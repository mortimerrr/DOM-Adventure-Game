The Dom
=======

We'll get to grips with the DOM and understand how webpages work.

# Install

1. Fork this repo
2. git clone your own copy to your projects folder.
3. cd ~/projects/the_dom
4. ruby test/dom_test.rb

# TODO

1. Open the my_amazing_webpage.html in Sublime, and have a look at its structure.
Split your sublime window and look at the dom_test.rb and fill in the blanks.

2. Create a second webpage with some dummy content. Create links between the two,
so that you can go backwards and forwards between them.

3. Create a choose your own path adventure game with no more than 10 pages.

4. Use CSS to pretty it up!


# Submission

Once you're done, push your code to your repo and send me a pull request.
